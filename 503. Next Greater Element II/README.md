## The complexity of the provided code is as follows:

### 1. Time Complexity:
   - The first traversal iterates over the entire array once, and the second traversal also iterates over the entire array once in a circular manner. Therefore, the total number of iterations is 2 times the length of the array, which is O(2n).
   - Within each iteration, the while loop inside the stack operations can perform at most n operations in total for both traversals combined.
   - Hence, the overall time complexity of the code is O(n).

### 2. Space Complexity:
   - The code uses additional space to store the intermediate results in the `res` array and the indices in the stack.
   - The space required for the `res` array is O(n) since it has the same length as the input array.
   - The space required for the stack is also O(n) in the worst case if all elements are pushed onto the stack.
   - Therefore, the overall space complexity of the code is O(n).

>In summary, the time complexity of the code is O(n), and the space complexity is O(n).
