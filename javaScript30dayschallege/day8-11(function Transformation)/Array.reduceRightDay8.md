### Array.reduceRight 

In JavaScript, there is no built-in reduce.Right function as part of the standard language. The reduce() method available for arrays is actually a left-associative reducer, which means it starts reducing from the first element and moves towards the last element of the array. This is often referred to as a "left fold."

However, there is a functional programming concept called "reduceRight" (or "foldRight") that you can implement yourself if needed. It performs a right-associative reduction, starting from the last element and moving towards the first element of the array. This means it applies the reduction from right to left.



>Keep in mind that the custom reduceRight function is just an illustration of the concept and may not be as efficient as native reduce() since it involves reversing the array first. If you often find yourself needing a reduceRight behavior, you might consider using libraries like Lodash or Underscore, which provide a built-in reduceRight method along with other utility functions.
