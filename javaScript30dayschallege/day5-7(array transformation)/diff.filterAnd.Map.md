***While arr.map() and arr.filter() can appear similar at first glance, they serve different purposes and perform different operations on an array.

### arr.map():

* Purpose: map() is used to create a new array with the same number of elements as the original array but with each element transformed based on a given function.
*Operation: It iterates over each element of the array and applies the callback function to each element, allowing you to modify or  transform each element and return a new value.
* Result: The result is a new array with the same length as the original array, containing the modified values.


### arr.filter():

* Purpose: filter() is used to create a new array containing only the elements that satisfy a given condition specified by a callback function.
* Operation: It iterates over each element of the array and applies the callback function to each element, determining whether to include or exclude the element from the new array based on the return value (a boolean) of the callback function.
* Result: The result is a new array containing only the elements that passed the condition defined in the callback function.


Let's illustrate the differences with examples:

Example using arr.map(): Doubling each element

```javascript
Copy code
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map((num) => num * 2);
console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
In this example, we use map() to double each element in the array, resulting in a new array with the transformed values.

Example using arr.filter(): Filtering even numbers

```javascript
Copy code
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0);
console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
In this example, we use filter() to create a new array containing only the even numbers from the original array.
